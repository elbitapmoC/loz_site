  heroDescription: `
    <p>Reuben was the firstborn son of Jacob. His name means <strong>"see it’s a son"</strong> (Genesis 29:32): <em>"And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me."</em></p>
    <br/>
    <p>The tribe of Reuben was included in the migration of the "Ten Tribes of Israel" to the Americas during the Persian captivity in 536 B.C.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>In Genesis 49:3, Jacob blesses Reuben: <em>"Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power."</em></p>
    <br/>
    <p><strong class="text-primary">"Excellency of Dignity":</strong> When we examine the Seminole Indians, they possessed this quality of nobility in their dress code. They wore mitres (turbans) unlike the war bonnets of their brothers, reminiscent of the priestly garments of Israel.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><strong class="text-primary">"Excellency of Power":</strong> The Seminoles were a powerful tribe. Ponce De Leon was killed by a poisoned dart in a battle against them. They were the only tribe to never willingly sign a peace treaty with the U.S. government, remaining "Unconquered."</p>

  historicalConnection: "Spanish explorer Antonio Montezinos visited the Seminoles in the mountains of Quito (before their migration to Florida). Upon hearing his words, they recited in Hebrew: 'Shema, Yisroel, Adonai Elohenu Adonai Ehod' (Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One). They confirmed they were of the tribe of Reuben.",

  modernDescription: `
    <p><strong class="text-primary">"Unstable as water..." (Genesis 49:4)</strong></p>
    <p>Reuben was described as "unstable as water" because they were always moving. During the Spanish invasion, the Seminoles were known to be a nomadic tribe traveling to Indian coastal towns in the Florida Keys, Bahamas, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. The name "Seminole" itself means "runaway" or "wild/untamed".</p>
    <br/>
    <p>They originally inhabited the mountains of Quito in South America before migrating to Florida. Despite the "Indian Removal Campaign" led by Andrew Jackson, the prophecy states: <em>"Let Reuben live and not die; and let not his men be few"</em> (Deuteronomy 33:6). Even though they faced slaughter, they were not utterly destroyed, and the Seminole Tribe of Florida survives and thrives today.</p>
