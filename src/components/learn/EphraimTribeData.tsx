  historicalConnection: `The Tribe of Ephraim migrated to the Americas following the Assyrian captivity (722 B.C.). The prophet Hosea describes Ephraim as "mixing himself among the people" (Hosea 7:8), which perfectly describes the Taino, Spanish, and African fusion found in Puerto Rico.
  
  Known indigenously as "Boriken" (Land of the Valiant Lord), the island has been a hub of culture and resilience. The prophecy of being a "silly dove without heart" (Hosea 7:11) is often seen as a reflection of the political status of the island, calling to Egypt (USA) and Assyria (Spain) throughout history.`,
  
  // Modern Identity Section
  modernPeopleTitle: "The People of Boriken",
  modernDescription: `
    <p class="mb-4">You are the descendants of Ephraim, the head of the Northern Kingdom. Your identity as Puerto Ricans is deeply rooted in the scriptural prophecies of abundance and mixing.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>"Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned."</strong> (Hosea 7:8)<br/>
    This metaphor of a cake baked on one side describes the unique racial and cultural blend that defines the Boricua people today.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>"I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing."</strong> (Hosea 8:12)<br/>
    Despite a deep spiritual heritage, the true identity of the people has often been obscured, but is now being awakened.</p>
