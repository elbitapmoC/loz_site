  heroDescription: `Zebulon, the 10th born son of Jacob and Leah, was prophesied to dwell at the haven of the sea. This ancient prophecy manifests today in the <span class="text-primary font-semibold">Panama Canal</span>, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, shortening the path for the world's valuable cargo. From the ancient Mayans to modern-day Guatemala and Panama, this tribe fulfills the destiny of being a haven for ships.`,

  historicalConnection: `The tribe of Zebulon migrated to the Americas around **536 B.C.** during the Persian captivity. Known in the Middle Ages as the **Mayans**, they built incredible civilizations in Guatemala and Panama.

Deuteronomy 33:18 prophesied, "Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out," referring to the Mayans traveling to meet their brothers, the Aztecs (Issachar), at places of worship like Teotihuacan and Chichen Itza.

However, this history also carries a dark shadow. As Hosea 8:13 foretold ("They sacrifice flesh..."), the Mayans fell into the practice of human sacrifice, forgetting their True Maker to worship idols like Quetzalcoatl and Chac.`,

  modernDescription: `
    <p class="mb-4">Today, the prophecy of being a "haven for ships" is undeniably fulfilled in the <strong>Panama Canal</strong>. Opened in 1914 and fully handed over to Panama in 2000, this waterway is the literal "haven of the sea" spoken of in Genesis.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">The history of this region includes the struggle for sovereignty, including the 1989 invasion of Panama involving General Manuel Noriega. Yet, the scriptural mark remains: you are the people of the deep waters and the hidden treasures of the sand.</p>
    
    <p class="italic text-muted-foreground mt-4 border-l-2 border-primary pl-4">
      "They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand." — Deuteronomy 33:19
