  badgeText: "The Ferocious Wolf",
  heroDescription: `Benjamin, the 12th born son of Jacob, was born in the shadow of death—his mother Rachel dying in the agony of his birth (Genesis 35:18). This tragic beginning foreshadowed a history of sorrow but also of immense power. Known as the "Ferocious Tribe," Benjamin is the Wolf that ravins—predatory, sharp, and unconquerable.`,
  
  heroCharacteristics: [
    {
      icon: Sword,
      title: "Ravin as a Wolf",
      description: "To 'ravin' is to tear, seize, and speak with violent boldness. Benjamin does not whisper; he howls."
    },
    {
      icon: Music,
      title: "Sonic Warfare", 
      description: "The 'howl' of Benjamin is the sonic warfare of Reggae and Dancehall, tearing down the lies of Babylon."

    {

      title: "Divine Shield",
      description: "Dwelling in safety 'between his shoulders' (Deut 33:12)—protected by the Most High in the Caribbean sanctuary."
    }
  ],
  
  historicalConnection: `The Tribe of Benjamin was not merely "transported"; they were trafficked. Betrayed and sold into the putrid bellies of slave ships, they were dragged to the West Indies to be broken.
  
  But the spirit of the Wolf could not be domesticated. The Maroons (from "Cimarron", wild/untamed) fled to the mountains, turning the jagged terrain into a weapon. They were guerilla warriors who possessed a primal instinct for survival, living by the creed: "Liberty or Death."`,

  modernPeopleTitle: "The Wolf Has Awakened",
  modernDescription: `
    <p class="mb-4">You are the descendants of Benjamin, the "Son of the Right Hand." Your history is one of survival against all odds, and your future is one of vengeance and rule.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>"Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey..."</strong> (Gen 49:27)<br/>
    The "Morning" is the awakening. After centuries of darkness, you are rising to "devour the prey"—to participate in the subjugation of your former oppressors.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>"...and at night he shall divide the spoil."</strong><br/>
    As the sun sets on the empire of the nations, Benjamin will take back the wealth and resources stolen from them. The Wolf is reclaiming its territory.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>The Sonic Howl</strong><br/>
    Your music—Reggae and Dancehall—is not entertainment; it is an indictment. Artists like Peter Tosh and Burning Spear have used this "howl" to eviscerate the lies of Babylon and invoke the judgment of the Most High.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 mt-6 text-primary">The Buried Truth: Historical Evidence</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">The identity of the West Indians has been deliberately hidden, but the truth has been exhumed.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>The Rabbi's Confession</strong><br/>
    In <em>"From Babylon to Timbuktu"</em> by Rudolph R. Windsor (p. 133), it is recorded: "Before Dr. Goodby published his book, 'The Lost Tribes a Myth', Rabbi Matthew organized a Hebrew congregation in 1918 and proclaimed that the black people of the United States and the West Indies are the original black Hebrews."</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>The Portuguese Connection</strong><br/>
    In <em>"Nature Knows no Color Line"</em> by J.A. Rogers (p. 123 & 130), it is found: "Many of the Jews who were banished from Portugal by John II settled in the West Indies. John Bigelo, who visited Jamaica in 1850, saw the descendants of these Jews and says they were Negroid (Black)."</p>
