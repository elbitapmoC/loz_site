  historicalConnection: `The tribes of Manasseh (Cubans) and Ephraim (Puerto Ricans) migrated to the Americas around **536 B.C.** during the Persian captivity. 

Historical accounts, such as those by **Friar Diego de Landa**, record natives of Yucatan stating their ancestors came from the East through "twelve roads through the sea." 

The explorer **Montezinos** also recorded an encounter with Seminole Indians (Reuben) who confirmed that the tribe of Joseph lived on nearby islands (Cuba and Puerto Rico), reciting the *Shema Yisroel* in Hebrew.`,

  modernDescription: `
    <p class="mb-4">You are the descendants of Manasseh. Your history is written in the Bible and in the very name of your land—Cuba, a land of fruitfulness.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Genesis 49:22 describes Joseph as a "fruitful bough by a well," a perfect description of the island life surrounded by water ("the deep that lieth under"). Your land produces precious fruits like mangoes, avocados, and sugar cane ("precious fruits brought forth by the sun" - Deut 33:14).</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">However, history also records the tragedy of the "East Wind" (Hosea 13:15)—the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors who looted the land and enslaved the people. Despite this, the prophecy states that Manasseh would become a people and be great (Gen 48:19).</p>
